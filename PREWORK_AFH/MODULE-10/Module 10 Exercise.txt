Put in the Time

I feel this will be my biggest struggle.  When I go home, I am always tempted to do other things.  Currently, I have a lot of real life events that are taking place and could be stretching me thin in the future.  I would also like to be more diligent about focusing at home to do work/reading/learning or whatever it is I need to do.  My motivation can drift off at times and I need to make sure I hold onto it.
